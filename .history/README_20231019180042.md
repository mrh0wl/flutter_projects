### Technologies Used

The Flutter anime app leverages a carefully curated selection of technologies to deliver a responsive, feature-rich, and user-friendly experience:

1. Riverpod: Empowering us with flexible state management, Riverpod ensures that our app's data is handled efficiently and displayed reactively. It simplifies complex data dependencies for a more predictable and scalable app.

2. GetIt: Facilitating dependency injection, GetIt ensures clean and maintainable code. It enables easy access to services and dependencies throughout the app, promoting code organization and testability.

3. Hive: As our local data storage solution, Hive provides efficient data persistence. It stores user preferences, favorite anime lists, and more, reducing the need for frequent API requests and enhancing the user experience.

4. SharedPreferences: For handling small-scale local data, SharedPreferences offers a straightforward and reliable approach. It manages app-related data such as settings and lightweight information.

5. UniLinks: Deep linking and routing are made seamless by UniLinks. Users can navigate to specific app content via URLs or links from other applications, enhancing the overall user experience.

6. Kitsu.io API: Our primary source of anime data, the Kitsu.io API, provides a vast database of anime content, enriching the app with up-to-date titles, details, and images.

In unison, these technologies create a powerful and cohesive foundation for our anime app, ensuring it's both feature-rich and responsive to the needs of anime enthusiasts.

## Netflix Clone

### Technologies Used

1. AutoRoute
AutoRoute was selected as the routing solution for this Netflix clone due to its ease of use and declarative routing approach. It simplifies navigation and deep linking within the app, making it a seamless experience for users. AutoRoute ensures that our app's navigation is clean, maintainable, and easy to extend as we add more screens and features.

2. Hive
Hive, a fast and lightweight local database, is utilized in the app for storing user data, watch history, and other relevant information. It provides efficient data persistence, ensuring that user preferences and watch progress are stored and retrieved swiftly. This enhances the overall user experience by allowing users to pick up where they left off and access personalized content.

3. SharedPreferences
SharedPreferences plays a crucial role in managing lightweight app-related data. It is used for storing settings, user preferences, and other small-scale data that doesn't require the full capabilities of a database like Hive. SharedPreferences is a reliable choice for handling such data, promoting a consistent and user-friendly experience.

4. PathProvider
PathProvider is integrated into the app to manage file system paths. It is particularly useful for accessing the device's file system to store and retrieve data. By utilizing PathProvider, we ensure that our app can efficiently work with files and directories, enhancing the functionality of features like offline downloads and local storage.

5. IMDB API
The IMDB API serves as our primary source of movie and TV show information. It provides access to a vast database of content details, including ratings, cast information, and synopses. By integrating this API, the app can offer a comprehensive and up-to-date collection of movies and TV shows to users, making it a one-stop destination for entertainment.

In summary, these technologies have been thoughtfully chosen to create a feature-rich and user-friendly Netflix clone. AutoRoute simplifies navigation, Hive and SharedPreferences handle local data storage, PathProvider enables efficient file system management, and the IMDB API enriches the app with a vast database of content. This combination of technologies ensures that our Netflix clone provides a seamless and enjoyable experience for users seeking high-quality entertainment.
