Summary of Technologies Used

Our Flutter anime app leverages a carefully curated selection of technologies to deliver a responsive, feature-rich, and user-friendly experience:

Riverpod: Empowering us with flexible state management, Riverpod ensures that our app's data is handled efficiently and displayed reactively. It simplifies complex data dependencies for a more predictable and scalable app.

GetIt: Facilitating dependency injection, GetIt ensures clean and maintainable code. It enables easy access to services and dependencies throughout the app, promoting code organization and testability.

Hive: As our local data storage solution, Hive provides efficient data persistence. It stores user preferences, favorite anime lists, and more, reducing the need for frequent API requests and enhancing the user experience.

SharedPreferences: For handling small-scale local data, SharedPreferences offers a straightforward and reliable approach. It manages app-related data such as settings and lightweight information.

UniLinks: Deep linking and routing are made seamless by UniLinks. Users can navigate to specific app content via URLs or links from other applications, enhancing the overall user experience.

Kitsu.io API: Our primary source of anime data, the Kitsu.io API, provides a vast database of anime content, enriching the app with up-to-date titles, details, and images.

In unison, these technologies create a powerful and cohesive foundation for our anime app, ensuring it's both feature-rich and responsive to the needs of anime enthusiasts.
